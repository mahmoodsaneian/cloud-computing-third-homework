# Cloud Computing Third Homework

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the application of **cloud computing** principles, leveraging various cloud services and technologies to solve a given problem or implement a service. It might involve the use of **distributed computing**, **cloud infrastructure** (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP), or related technologies. The objective is to showcase how cloud platforms can enhance scalability, flexibility, and manageability of systems.

## Features  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Uses cloud services (e.g., computing, storage, and networking).  
- **Distributed Computing**: Implements algorithms or services across distributed cloud resources.  
- **Scalability**: Scales application or service dynamically based on demand.  
- **Automation**: Leverages cloud tools for automation and management.  
- **Service Deployment**: Deploys cloud-native services or microservices in a cloud environment.

## Technologies Used  
- **Cloud Platform** (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- **Java/Spring Boot** (or any other backend technology)  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration (if applicable)  
- **CI/CD** tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)  
- **Infrastructure as Code** (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)  

## Requirements  
- A cloud account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- **Docker** installed  
- **Kubernetes** (if applicable)  
- **Java** or the programming language used for the backend  
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (if applicable for Java projects)  
- **Terraform** or other IaC tools (if applicable)

## Setup  

### Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mahmoodsaneian/cloud-computing-third-homework.git
cd cloud-computing-third-homework
```

### How to Run  

1. **Dockerize the application** (if not already done):
   - Create a `Dockerfile` and build the container:
     ```sh
     docker build -t <image-name> .
     ```

2. **Run the application locally** (if no cloud deployment yet):
   - For a Spring Boot project:
     ```sh
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

3. **Deploy to the Cloud**:
   - If using Kubernetes, deploy using `kubectl`:
     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     ```
   - Alternatively, deploy using **Terraform** or **CloudFormation** (if applicable).

### Cloud Deployment Configuration  
- Set up your cloud environment (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine).
- Deploy the application using infrastructure-as-code (e.g., using **Terraform**).

## Example  
- If your project involves deploying a **Spring Boot** app on AWS, the README can explain how the application is containerized and then deployed to an **ECS** or **EKS** cluster.
